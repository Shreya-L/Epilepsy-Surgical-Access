# Epilepsy Surgical Access in the United States

# About 

The majority of epilepsy patients are treated medically. A subset of patients are 
drug-resistant and 
become candidates for epilepsy surgery. Although not all 
drug-resistant patients are surgical candidates, those who are, have success rates of 
roughly ~ 80% [1]. The challenge for these drug-resistant patients in obtaining epilepsy 
surgery often is a result of decreased rates of refferal for epilepsy surgical 
consultations or a lack of access to nearby epilepsy level 4 centers that specialize in 
intracranial electrode evaluations, comprehensive neuropsychologic testing, and advanced 
surgical care.

# Area Deprivation Index

The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is based on a measure created by the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) over two decades ago for primarily county-level use, but refined, adapted, and validated to the Census block group/neighborhood level by Amy Kind, MD, PhD [2]. It was initially created by Singh in 2003 to create a measure of socioeconomic disadvantage for neighborhoods based on zip-codes allowing for neighborhood risk to be assessed in an efficient way that is easily accessible to clinicans [2,3]. The ADI takes into account US Census data primarily poverty, housing, education, and employment indicators and has been shown in numerous studies to be associated with health outcomes particularly in cancer (e.g breast, colorectal and prostate cancers)[4]. 

This is a map of US county-level ADI scores using data from the 2017 US Census American Community Survey-5. The points on the map represent the location of level 4 epilepsy centers. There is a clear lack of access and Level 4 centers in counties with higher ADI scores (representing areas of increased disadvantage).
