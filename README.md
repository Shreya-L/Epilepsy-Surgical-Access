# About 

The majority of epilepsy patients are treated medically. A subset of patients are 
drug-resistant and 
become candidates for epilepsy surgery. Although not all 
drug-resistant patients are surgical candidates, those who are, have success rates of 
roughly ~ 80% [1]. The challenge for these drug-resistant patients in obtaining epilepsy 
surgery often is a result of decreased rates of refferal for epilepsy surgical 
consultations or a lack of access to nearby epilepsy level 4 centers that specialize in 
intracranial electrode evaluations, comprehensive neuropsychologic testing, and advanced 
surgical care.
